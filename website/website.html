                    <h1><u>Basic Information</u></h1>
                    <div class="image-with-info"><img src="image/basic info.png"height="40px" border="2px"></div>
                </div>
                <p>
                So firstly lets talk about IIT-JEE,<br>
                Its nothing just name of colleges IIT here means Indian Institute of Technology and JEE means The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)
                is an engineering entrance assessment conducted for admission to various engineering colleges in India.<br>
                It is constituted by two different examinations: the JEE Main and the JEE Advanced.</p>
                
            </div>
        </div>  
    
        <div class="para2">So I think you have got basic info about this.<br>
                So lets move ahead about the exam so the exam has 2 level.
                <div class="list1">
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        JEE Mains
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JEE Advance
                    </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            Here JEE-Mains is easier and about ncert level but JEE-Advance a more higher than ncert level,But do not fear its 
            cutoff are low for clearance and no one get full marks not the rank 1 too.
        </div>
    </div>    
</div>
<div class="cutoff-other">
    <div class="cutoff">
        <div class="cutoff-h1">
            <h1>
                <u>Cutoff</u>

        </div>
        <div class="cutoff-image"><img src="image/cutoff.png"height="80px"></div>
        
    </div>
    <br>so the cutoff of some years is below,<br>
</div>
<div class="image-2"><img id="data" src="https://jeemains.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/JEE-Main-Cut-Off-Trends-Analysis-e1608372012382.png">
</div>
<div class="para3"><P> Now,lets talk about how many times you can take exam, so according to latest news now JEE Main is conducted 4 times a year from 2021
        this is the latest news but advance only 1 time in year and to prepare for this you must study hard and use 3-4 books to get a high rank about which we will talk later. 
        So the lectures are there on my channel so kindly visit my channel,

    </ul>
</div>
<div class="para4"><p>
        So now lets talk about from where to prepare,actually this is not a big problem as many free content are available online also many books are there to prepare and also my channel is there to let you prepare.
    But many student has problem that how much time to study and also what must be the timings.
    So I have a timetable to help to prepare and also this can not be as exact for you so you can make changes daily on it too to get a better result.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="timetable">
    <div class="time-table-heading">
        <div class="heading-timetable">
            <h1><u>Time Table</u></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="image-timetable"><img src="image/timetable.png" height="150px"></div>
    </div>
        <div class="timetable-p">

            <p> Hey so today I am going to tell you a bit about the plan which you can use to adjust your own timetable actually that do not means that you can not use mine timetable but it will be helpful to you if you make a time table and list of tasks daily basis. But if you make a large timetable for example for 1 month then it will be hard to follow so my suggestion is to make on daily basis and use mine as a secondary ways to fix timings.

            so first of all I will tell 2 type of timetable for you all and remember to read whole to get excellent tips at middles of these lines that do not means at the center of line.
            
            so the first is likely for people with less will for wake up early in the morning and second for people who can wake up early in the morning and both will be equally effective but second one a little extra effective.
            
            so The first one is like think you wake up at 8am in the morning so what you going to do first get fresh in half a hour or in 1 and took the first task mention in your table of task and sit for about an hour up to 10am if started at 9am then took a 5min rest if get bored or new to long study but if comfortable continue with that for 11am and then took a small break and eat something and get some fun like TV or anything you want .Then come the second part of study at 1pm after 2 hour break sit in a room where no one come to be focused now be focused for about 2 hour up to 3pm or you can sit till 4pm now its time for a break go for a walk or playing outside but go so that your mind can relax .Now upto 6pm assume you play now go for bath have some rest or eat something up to 7pm its study time after 7pm sit for study up to 9pm and remember to have water with you so that your body will be heathy. Now after 9pm have dinner and some gossup with family up to 10pm now its time for last hour of study from 10pm to 11pm and immediately after 11pm go for sleep and do not do any work like watching phone or TV and follow same timetable.
            
            Now first part is complete for late waking people 
            
            Now its time for early waking people
            
            Firstly try to wake at 4am or at 5am at least and be fresh and then at 4:15 sit for study up to 6:15 or up to 7:15 with small break of 5min after every hour or 2 now go for yoga or playing up to 9 or 10am then have lunch and after that be fresh take bath and be ready for next study session at 11am now study till 1 pm and then take a break up to 3pm and then be ready for next study at 3pm till 5pm and then go for walk or jogging or playing outdoor games and be home till 7pm and then have dinner and watch TV or have family talk and then go to bed till 8pm
            
            and my last tips are never go for phone or laptop more than an hour or 2.</p>
