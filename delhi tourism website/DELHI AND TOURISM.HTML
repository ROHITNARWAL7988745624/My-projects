                urban area according to the United Nations.Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area
                    have ranked Delhi either the most or second-most productive metro area of India. Delhi is the 
                    second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires.

        <div class="para_inside1">The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata.
             The town was known as Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. ... The early Mughal emperors
              favoured Agra as their capital,
             and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah Jahan built (1638) the walls of Old Delhi.</div>

            <p>
            On 12 November 1736, the Maratha general Baji Rao I advanced on Old Delhi to attack the Mughal capital.
            Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah sent Saadat Ali Khan I with a 150,000-strong army to stop the Maratha advance on Delhi.
            But Baji Rao's subordinate chiefs Malhar Rao Holkar and Pilaji Jadhav crossed the river Yamuna and looted Ganga-Yamuna Doab. 
            Saadat Khan then retired to Mathura, 
            thinking the Marathas had retreated towards Pune. But Baji Rao's army advanced to Delhi and encamped near Talkatora.
